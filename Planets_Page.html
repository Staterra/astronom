                    The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
                    It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,
                    heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, 
                    radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. 
                    It is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
                    The Sun's diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers ,
                    or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, 
                    comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
                    Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, the rest is mostly helium, 
                    with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.

                    Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.
                    Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, 
                    Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit, 
                    and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. 
                    This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, 
                    usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright object, 
                    but is more difficult to observe than Venus.
                    the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, 
                    similar to Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.

                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun.
                    As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, 
                    Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
                    Venus's orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47° thus, 
                    at latitudes with a day-night cycle, 
                    it is most readily visible for up to a few hours following the start of sunset or before sunrise. At times, 
                    It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. 
                    it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System
                    This means that the Sun rises from its western horizon and sets in its east.

                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
                    While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, 
                    only Earth sustains liquid surface water. 
                    About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, 
                    dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. 
                    The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, 
                    consisting of continents and islands. 
                    Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, 
                    interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. 
                    Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, 
                    deflecting destructive solar winds.

                    Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, 
                    being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war. 
                    Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, 
                    and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to Earth's crust, 
                    as well as a core made of iron and nickel. 
                    Mars has surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. 
                    It also has two small and irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos.
                    Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include features such as Olympus Mons, 
                    the largest volcano and highest known mountain.

                    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
                    It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, 
                    but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. 
                    Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, 
                    and it has been observed since prehistoric times.
                    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. 
                    It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements like the other giant planets in the Solar System, 
                    but it lacks a well-defined solid surface.

                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, 
                    after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.
                    It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth however, with its larger volume, 
                    Saturn is over 95 times more massive.
                    Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds).
                    Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, 
                    an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, 
                    a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.

                    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. 
                    Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology. 
                    It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. 
                    Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, 
                    and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. 
                    For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets.
                    Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium but it contains more "ices".

                    Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. 
                    In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, 
                    the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. 
                    It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. 
                    Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. 
                    It is referred to as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being its Uranus).
                    Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, 
                    it has no well-defined "solid surface". 
                    The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8.
